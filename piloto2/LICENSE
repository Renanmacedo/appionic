All rights reserved

1. This License grants you, the purchaser, an ongoing, non-exclusive, worldwide license to make use of the digital work (Item) contained in this package. 
Read the rest of this license for the details that apply to your use of the Item.

2. You are licensed to use the Item to create multiple End Products for yourself or for one single client.

3. An End Product is one of the following things, both requiring an application of skill and effort:

(a) For an Item that is a complete template, the End Products is a customised implementation of the Item.
For example: the item is a full website theme and the end product is the final website customised with your content.

(b) For other types of Item, an End Product is a work that incorporates the Item as well as other things, so that it is larger in scope and different in nature than the Item.
For example: the item is a button graphic and the end product is a website.

## Things you can do with the Item.

4. You can create multiple End Products for a client, and you can transfer that single End Product to your client for any fee. This license is not transferred to your client.

5. You can make any number of copies of End Products.

6. You can modify or manipulate the Item. You can combine the Item with other works and make a derivative work from it. You can do these things as long as the End Product you then create is one that’s permitted under clause 3.
For example: You can license a flyer template, include your own photos, modify the layout and get it printed to promote your event.

## Things you can't do with the Item

7. You can’t re-distribute the Item as stock, in a tool or template, or with source files. You can’t do this with an Item either on its own or bundled with other items, and even if you modify the Item. You can’t re-distribute or make available the Item as-is or with superficial modifications. These things are not allowed even if the re-distribution is for Free.

8. Although you can modify the Item and therefore delete unwanted components before creating an End Product, you can’t extract and use a single component of an Item on a stand-alone basis in order to sell or distribute it separately from the Item.
For example: You license a website theme containing icons. You can delete unwanted icons from the theme. But you can't extract an icon to use outside of the theme.

9. You must not permit an end user of the End Products to extract the Item and use it separately from the End Products.

Other license terms

10. You can only use the Item for lawful purposes. Also, if an Item contains an image of a person, even if the Item is model-released you can’t use it in a way that creates a fake identity, implies personal endorsement of a product by the person, or in a way that is defamatory, obscene or demeaning, or in connection with sensitive subjects.

11. This license applies in conjunction with the Ionic Marketplace Terms for your use of Ionic Marketplace. If there is an inconsistency between this license and the Ionic Marketplace Terms, this license will apply to the extent necessary to resolve the inconsistency.

12. This license can be terminated if you breach it. If that happens, you must stop making copies of or distributing the End Products until you remove the Item from it.

13. The author of the Item retains ownership of the Item but grants you the license on these terms. This license is between the author of the Item (INMAGIK SRL) and you.

IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER
