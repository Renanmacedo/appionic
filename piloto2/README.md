# DeepBlue Kit version 1.1

A styled template pack for Ionic

DeepBlue kit is an original ionic theme with included templates (based on SASS) that includes the following screens:

- start, login, forgotten password, signup, account views
- feed view with pull-to-refresh interaction
- shop view with list of products, working shopping cart persisting to localStorage and checkout view. The shop view integrates $ionicActionSheet service and provides a custom badge style to show the number of products in cart.

The theme is built with SASS and can be further customized.

The kit has no other dependencies than Ionic in order to guarantee the maximun flexibility and extensibility. It's been built using ionic v. 1.1.0.

Please note that some sections of the app, such as login, signup and checkout, are only templates and must be connected to real services in order to work.

The general app structure provided must be intented as a demonstration of use of the theme and a collection of common patterns that can be used in building an ionic app and you probably might want to rearrange screens in a different way in your final application.
